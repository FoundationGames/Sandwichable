## Forge? 1.12 - 1.15?
No.<br/>
Reasons? It would be a lot of work to rewrite the entire mod for another platform/version, and I don't personally enjoy Forge as a development platform. See also: [a gist by JellySquid](https://gist.github.com/jellysquid3/8b68b81a5e48462f8690284a0a3c89a1)

## Quick Start Guide
<img src="https://github.com/FoundationGames/MinecraftUtilsDownloads/raw/master/sandwichable/sandwichable_blocks.png" align="center"/> <br/><br/>
You can see how to use the various blocks and items of Sandwichable by holding `Shift` while hovering over items to see the extended tooltips. Works great with *REI*. <br/> <br/>

#### Making a Sandwich
1. Craft a **Sandwich Table**.
2. Gather some **Bread**. You may slice it up on a **Cutting Board**.
3. Find some ingredients for your sandwich. If you can, slice them up so they can restore more overall hunger.
4. Place (Right-Click) your **Bread** on the **Sandwich Table**, and stack your ingredients on top. Make the sandwich as tall as you want! Top it off with one last piece of **Bread**.
5. With an empty hand, sneak and right-click on the **Sandwich Table**. A completed **Sandwich** will pop right off!
6. You can place your **Sandwich** by sneaking, or eat it whole. If you have *Meal API* installed, your **Sandwich** may fill past your hunger bar's limit!
